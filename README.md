# Blockly C++ #

This project was created around the time I got my Associates Degree. It was mainly intended as a visual aid for students learning C++ as their first programming language. 
The project development lasted from November 2019, to August 2020. Some updates were made until mid November 2020.

To see my specific development, go to demos->code, mainly in code/Blocks, code/js, and code/index.html.

## Library changes ##
In Blockly C++, two core files have been edited.

- core/block.js

- core/field_dropdown.js

## How to use Blockly C++ ##
Blockly C++ can be used locally by going to demos/code and opening "index.html" with a browser.
